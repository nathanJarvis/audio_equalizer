# audio_equalizer
An audio equalizer is a tool for adjusting the amplitudes of individual frequency bands within a recording. They are commonly used to process music recordings. This report describes the construction and implementation of an audio equalizer using an FPGA to allow real-time processing and attenuation of 13 separate frequency bands. The final design uses each of the previous projects for this class, and culminated in a successful demonstration.
